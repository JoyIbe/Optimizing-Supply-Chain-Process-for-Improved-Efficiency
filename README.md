# Onyx Data November 2024 Challenge

## Title: Supply Chain Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis reveals a transparent view of the dataset showcasing supply chain performance from production to distribution. This will aid stakeholders in optimizing supply processes and making more informed decisions.
I have curated two well-detailed and interactive dashboards that provide insights into products, supplier performance, logistics, and inventory trends. 

## Data Source:
Onyx Data provided this dataset via their LinkedIn profile. It contained 26 columns and 100 rows.

2. Power BI: Visualization.

## Data Processing:
I deployed Power BI DAX's functionality to track total KPI metrics amongst essential data fields such as product type and Shipping carriers.

## Data Analysis:
Overview: I have identified key revenue drivers, including product performance, customer demographics, SKU performance, to gain a clear understanding of inventory trends and availability.

Supplier and Logistics: This analysis uncovered supplier performance, shipping analysis and transportation modes.

## Dashboard:

## Key Findings:
- Total revenue generated was 577.60k.

- Product type: Skincare products generated 40% with 241.63k of the revenue which is the highest compared to haircare's 30% and cosmetics 28%. It also has the highest defect rate, requiring quality control improvements.

- Geographically, Mumbai generates the highest revenue with over 138k.

- Customer Demographics: Female Customers contributes the majority of revenue.

- Manufacturing cost: Skincare products cost more to produce with over 41% gap.

- SKU Performance: SKU 51,38,31,90, 2.. generates the highest revenue in this top 5 hierarchy.

- Inventory: The stock level totaled to 4,777 units with an average lead time of 16 days. Adequate marketing strategies should be implemented to bridge or minimize the gap between product volumes and product sold.

- Inspection Result: Skincare products and Supplier 1 records the most number of passes and proves to be  more viable.

- Supplier Performance: Supplier 1 generates the most revenue, has the highest lead time variation, which could impact delivery times and customer satisfaction.

- Logistics: Total shipping cost equals 554.81 with Carrier A having the highest shipping costs, suggesting a need for cost optimization strategies.
- Road is the most preferred transportation mode by customers, but it also has the highest average shipping cost.

## Recommendations:
By implementing the following recommended actions, the company can optimize its supply chain, improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth:

- Products with more sales should always be in stock to boost revenue.  

- Locations with lower sales and revenue may require localized marketing or distribution strategies.
  
- Explore alternative suppliers to reduce reliance on Supplier 1.
  
- Prioritize timely deliveries to improve customer satisfaction.
  
- Optimize delivery routes and prioritize Carrier C to minimize transportation costs and delivery time.

- Implement quality improvement initiatives like waste management to reduce defect rates.
